Oct 22 The Project is under guidance of Dr Lorenzo Moneta It involves development of a fast inference system in TMVA called SOFIE that takes ONNX model as input and produces compilation-ready standalone C scripts as output This project focuses on development of some missing deep learning operations which will allow to build more complex networks within TMVA and also to write the corresponding unit tests need to validate the written code The contributions will be presented in an international Conference at ACAT 2022 in October 2022 Shabadmitra Project NLP Machine Learning Android Programming Oct 22 - Present The Project is under guidance of Dr Pushpak Bhattacharyya The idea of the research project is to create mappings of synsets among languages in IndoWordnet and linking it with Princetons Wordnet Currently manual adding/ mapping of synsets and concepts are done which is inefficient The motive is to find the word embeddings of synsets including each of the words in gloss example synset and synonyms then calculate the synset embeddings Then we need to find the cosine similarity between the embeddings of synsets and provide automatic linking between the synsets of different languages Information Geometry and Geometric Deep Learning NLP Deep Learning Graph Algorithms June 22 - Present The Project is under guidance of DrIrfan Siddavatam The idea of the research project is to extract the relevant information for each specific subject from the given text using a Clustering algorithm and assign tags to every object and its attributes Then we need to represent the data in terms of graph using Formal Concept Analysis by creating my own Formal Concept Generator The next step is to use geometric deep learning and contextualization to learn from the graph and the end goal is to give results for which data is related to what subject At the end we will compare our results with existing NLP applications and do the benchmarking of the results which will be demonstrated in the research paper Projects Sketch-2-Paint CGANs Linear Algebra Deep Learning Python Tensorflow Aug 21 - Sept 21 This project involved building a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network which accepts a 256x256 px black and white sketch image and predicts the colored version of the image without knowing the ground truth We have not only seen how a Conditional GAN works but also have successfully implemented it to predict colored images from the given black and white input sketch images The model will be trained on the Anime Sketch-Colorization Pair Dataset available on Kaggle which contains 142k pairs of Sketch-Color Anime Images Multi-Cam-ReID Computer Vision Yolo Object tracking Machine Learning Jun 22 - Present The project aims to do multi camera object tracking Input Video Detections are generated from Yolo-v4 model Implemented algorithms like Centroid tracker IOU tracker Sort and Deep Sort We have implemented our own IOU prediction tracker which gives better results on Occlusions This algorithms were part of single camera object tracking Currently working on a 3-layer hierarchical model for tracking people across non-overlapping cameras using person re-identification techniques Sociablast-A ChatBot Application React JsNode JsMongo DBSocketIO Nov 21 -
